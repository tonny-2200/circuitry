## 📌 Goals of This Project

circuitry.ai aims to combine computer vision and large language models to help users **analyze**, **understand**, and **learn from** circuit diagrams.  
We're open-sourcing this project to invite collaboration, fresh ideas, and better solutions to the complex challenge of understanding electronic schematics automatically.

## 🚧 Priority Improvements (You Can Help With!)

These are high-priority areas where your contributions are most welcome:

### 🧩 Connection Detection Logic (High Priority)
- Improve detection of **wires and junctions** between components
- Use OpenCV (e.g., Hough Line Transform, contour tracing) or any suitable graph-building method
- Goal: convert visual layout into a netlist-like structure

### 🛠️ OCR for Circuit Text (High Priority)
- Implement and refine OCR to read:
  - Component labels (R1, C2)
  - Values (e.g., 100Ω, 10µF)
  - IC pin names or voltage annotations
- Libraries like Tesseract or EasyOCR are a good start

### 🔍 YOLO Annotation Expansion
- Contribute to improving the **YOLOv8 training dataset**
- Add new components (diodes, transistors, ICs, etc.)
- Help with bounding box labeling (LabelImg, CVAT, Roboflow, etc.)

### 🧠 Better LLM Reasoning with LLaMA 3
- Fine-tune or prompt engineer LLaMA 3 for more accurate, structured circuit explanations
- Create input templates based on detected components + OCR
- Suggest alternatives like Claude, GPT-4, or Mistral if feasible

### 🌐 Web Deployment
- Make the app deployable to Hugging Face Spaces, Replit, or Dockerized for easy use
- Ensure smooth model loading and file handling in hosted environments

### 📱 Mobile-Friendly Interface
- Create a responsive front end that works well on phones and tablets
- Suggest or implement a PWA version
