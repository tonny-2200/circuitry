## 🧠 circuitry.ai – Understand Circuit Diagrams with AI

**circuitry.ai** is an open-source tool that combines computer vision and large language models to **detect**, **analyze**, and **explain electronic circuit diagrams**.

It leverages YOLOv8 for component detection and LLaMA 3 for generating intelligent textual explanations of how the circuit works. The goal is to bridge the gap between visual schematic representations and conceptual understanding, making electronics more accessible to learners, hobbyists, and engineers alike.

### ✨ Why Open Source?

This project is now open source to invite the community to help solve some of the challenges and limitations I couldn’t tackle alone. By collaborating, we can expand its capabilities and make circuit interpretation smarter, faster, and more intuitive.

### 🚧 Planned Improvements & Contributions Welcome

These are some improvements I hope to implement with help from the community:

* 🧩 **Better connections detection using OpenCV or any suitable method. (Priority)
* 🛠️ **Implementation of OCR in Circuit Diagrams.(Priority)
* 🔍 **Better YOLO annotations** and expanded support for more component types (e.g., ICs, relays, diodes)
* 🧠 **Fine-tuned reasoning using LLaMA 3** or similar models for more accurate and educational explanations
* 🌐 **Deployable web version** (e.g., via Hugging Face Spaces, Replit, or Docker)
* 📱 **Mobile-friendly interface** for use in classrooms or on the go

### 🤝 Get Involved

If you're passionate about AI, computer vision, electronics, or education, your contributions are welcome. Whether it's improving the model, designing a better UI, or writing documentation—there's space for everyone.

**Let's build something impactful together.**
